Changes in Stats.mod: (since v1.0.1)
--------------------

1.4.0

- !place now also accepts username _and_ stat-type at once as
  parameter
- new setting: $autoadd-min-lines
- users can now login via WWW and change their info
- added info: icq#

  if it detected an incompatible eggdrop version)
- new langfile entries: 
         "place" (#502)
         T idle idle-factor
- new stat-type: idle (factor of minutes and lines) (idea by Zev)
- !stat and !place had some problems with users from the stats-userbase
- fixed problem with strict-host 0 (I hate this setting! It's useless and only
  causes confusion and bugs! Maybe someone should remove it from eggdrop*sigh*)

  online-time for each client anymore. (fix by Zev Toledano)
- !stat wasn't using langfiles for parts of the output
